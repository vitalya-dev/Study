00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
thanks to curiositystream for sponsoring

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,560
this video

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,279
welcome folks to a coding challenge i

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,040
have done one of these in a while i'm

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,080
gonna set myself a timer here and i'm

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,559
going to attempt to make a slide puzzle

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,160
so this is the source image that i'm

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
going to use i need to chop it up into a

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,279
bunch of pieces

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,359
allow you to like click to move the

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,600
pieces around and see if you could solve

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
it to put it back together and have

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
something detect when it's put back

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
together that it works all right so one

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
of the things that we need to use that i

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,479
need to use for this is the copy

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,320
function um because what i want to do

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
first is just take this image and chop

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
it up into a bunch of smaller images so

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
let me call those

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
uh the pieces and i'll make an array

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
and then in setup i should figure out

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
how many columns and rows that i want so

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
let's just make it it's

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
right now it's a 400 by 400 so let's

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
just make it 4x4

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
and i also i'm going to probably want to

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,559
keep track of like the width and height

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,000
of each piece

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
i probably should do this in like an

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
object-oriented way where there's like

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,040
class piece and that's not happening

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
right now

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
four let i equal zero i is less than the

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,439
number of columns

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,600
uh j

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
is less than zero j less than the number

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
of rows

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
w is the width of the canvas divided by

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
the number of columns h is the height of

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
the canvas divided by the number of rows

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,640
and then

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
for each one of these i need to make a

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,360
new image or the new the image is a

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
piece of the larger image so i need to

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
take the source image and copy from it

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
oh i think i could just use get i'm

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,119
really obsessed with the idea of using

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,119
copy because hopefully by the time this

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
video comes out there will be an entire

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
video all about the copy function in

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
processing in p5

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
let's look at the reference

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,680
get i believe

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,240
it returns an array of rgba values which

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
is not what i want i want an actual like

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
image maybe copy is what i want i know

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,600
copy will work in the sense that i can

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,160
copy from this image onto this image

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,598
let's use copy

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
so this is fine i'm going to use copy

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,040
because i know it's going to work and

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
the first thing i'll do is create a

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
blank image

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
that is

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
the size of one of the pieces

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,239
i really want to use the whiteboard just

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,720
because i have a whiteboard so the idea

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
here is i have a source image

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
and what i first want to do is on my

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,879
canvas

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,000
i'm going to chop this up one two three

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,040
one two three into four by four and i

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
want to take this section of the image

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,599
and place it on the canvas but keep this

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
as a separate variable like a piece so

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,519
that these pieces can be locked to a

78
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
part of the original oh i really need i

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,879
just need to know i'm going to i got to

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,800
do this object-oriented right because

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
the piece

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
should know where its home base is as

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
well as where it currently is so if

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,519
they're being shuffled when all the

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
pieces are in the right place we've won

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
so what do i need to make a class

87
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
a piece class

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
that has

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
a current index

90
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
like if i number all these zero one two

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
three four five six seven blah blah blah

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,080
blah i wanna keep track of where it

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
currently is as well as where it's

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
original spot it's it's home bases so we

95
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
know when the puzzle's solved all right

96
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
let's let's do that it's worth it it'll

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,599
be worth it so let me uh i got to open

98
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,799
this up here i'm going to make a new

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,159
javascript file and i'm going to call it

100
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,799
piece.js

101
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640
tile it's probably tile is what they are

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,239
right let's call it uh tile dot js

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
so i have a tile class

104
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,360
what does it have in it it has

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
the index

106
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
so i'm going to pass that in as an

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,879
argument and

108
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,159
it has its image

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
so i mean there's probably more to do

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
with this but i'm basically just want to

111
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
wrap the idea of the image's piece and

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
where it's supposed to be in to this

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,159
constructor okay good here we go so now

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,840
what i'm actually doing is i'm still

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
creating the image

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
then i'm saying copy

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
uh

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
what am i copying i'm copying from the

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
source

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
zero zero oh no no no no no

121
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
the in the source the x location is i

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,839
times the width the y location is j

123
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,960
times

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,919
h

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,840
and i'm copying from the source

126
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,759
i j

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,360
with height

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,639
two

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
zero zero with height so if this is

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
confusing to you

131
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,520
thank goodness i have a white board each

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,840
one of these

133
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,320
pieces is an image where this is zero

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
zero and its height is with an h but if

135
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
i'm copying this one

136
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,100
and it's

137
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,280
[Music]

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
column two

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
row one boy this is like so messy this

140
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
whiteboard but that's fine um then

141
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
basically i need to know what is this

142
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,960
location this location is column times

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,000
width

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,639
row times height and then so take this

145
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,479
section and copy it to this part of the

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,280
piece

147
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
and i think this is right right it's um

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,720
it should be the source image source x

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
source y source to the destination i

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
want to copy the source image at this

151
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,919
location

152
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
to this destination which is image at

153
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,039
this location great then i need to make

154
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,160
a

155
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
a tile is a new tile

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
index and then the image now what is the

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
index

158
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
the index

159
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,680
is the uh i'm not going to use any

160
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
two-dimensional arrays here i'm just

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
going to keep track of um the the the

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
individual index counting zero one two

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
three four five six seven eight nine ten

164
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
zero 15 16 total tiles so the index

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
is i

167
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
plus j times the number of columns oh

168
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
let's call this tiles

169
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
let's just put all the tiles into an

170
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
array

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
just out of curiosity now

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
let me loop through that array

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
and

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
okay i have an idea let's make a

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,560
variable called board

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
so this is the board the board is an

177
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,479
array of all of the elements in the

178
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,880
order that they're in so board

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
push index

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
so basically i'm going to have an array

181
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
that keeps track of the positions of all

182
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
of the tiles

183
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,000
and then

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,440
this is a little bit silly but i'm going

185
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,199
to do it this way i'm going to just

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,960
always use a nested loop just to get

187
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
that index

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,199
and then i'm going to say board

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,280
index show so let me just do uh

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
let me think about this for a second let

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
me be a little bit more thoughtful here

192
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
i'm i was trying to avoid using a

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
two-dimensional array

194
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
but maybe that's silly so i want to have

195
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
this array

196
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
which i'm going to call board and it's

197
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
going to have like it'll be

198
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,440
all of the numbers shuffled in random

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
order so as i go through

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
i yes i draw the image

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,199
at that spot

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
like the zero spot what the zero spot

203
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,000
would be x and y but i go look up

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
image

205
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,039
three or index three from my uh array of

206
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,039
all the tiles i don't know if that made

207
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,560
sense but i had to walk over to the

208
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
whiteboard to sort of think through that

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
in other words x is this is exactly what

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
i'm doing

211
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
x is i times w

212
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
y is j times h

213
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
and then the image i want to draw is

214
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
board

215
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
index

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
it's actually like tiles board

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
index i mean this is like a crazy way to

218
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
write it but i basically want the number

219
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
the index that's in the array called

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,039
board to tell me which tile to look up

221
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
so this is tile i'll call it like tile

222
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,479
index or

223
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,919
right now they'll be in order because i

224
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,440
haven't shuffled it right i'm putting

225
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
them all in order and then i should be

226
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
able to say image image

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
x comma y so i'm hoping that when i run

228
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,280
this sketch i'm going to identically see

229
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
the image because the only things that

230
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,919
i've done is chop it up into a bunch of

231
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,280
tiles put them into an array in order

232
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,199
and then i'm going and getting them one

233
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
at a time and showing them

234
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
all right what happened uh oh oh am i

235
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
supposed to do create image yeah so i

236
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,799
think i did the dom image element by

237
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,679
accident

238
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,720
tile is not defined oh so no problem

239
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
no problem yep

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
tile.js that's a file i'm working with

241
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
thank you very much

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
uh

243
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,760
failed to actually draw load pixels

244
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
yeah create image load picks maybe i

245
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,959
just need to call load pixels i thought

246
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,200
to do copy i don't need to but i must

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,680
and then let's do like image update

248
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,519
pixels

249
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
let's try that

250
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
signature not supported what is going on

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
oh look at this i deleted some stuff ah

252
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
i when i was like mucking around some

253
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,680
stuff got deleted i need all those

254
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
numbers all those numbers and i want to

255
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
sort copy it from x comma y

256
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,760
nice

257
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
[Applause]

258
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,160
okay

259
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,519
i don't even know if i need all these

260
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,920
load pixels and update pixels

261
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
still good

262
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,240
okay everybody

263
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,959
oh image equals tile dot image so i need

264
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,360
to pull the image property out of the

265
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,839
tiles

266
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
no okay

267
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
let's take out all these like

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
load pixels and update pixels yeah okay

269
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
i didn't need any of the low pixels and

270
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,959
update pixels there's a little bit of a

271
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,600
mystery here i have a feeling here copy

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
is doing the work for us so

273
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
we're good now you might not believe me

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
now this is actually showing it as

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
separate tiles now let me let me prove

276
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,600
this by just drawing some lines over it

277
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
this is gonna be a slightly awkward way

278
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,399
of doing it

279
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,399
but let me just do stroke weight two no

280
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
fill

281
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,640
oh but this is silly if i change this to

282
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
like width minus 10 height minus like if

283
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
i make the images smaller

284
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
right okay i just wanted to show you

285
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
that i am actually they are separate

286
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,399
pieces so i i visually it might help i

287
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,959
think to actually just draw

288
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
little thin lines over it with the

289
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
rectangles

290
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,959
and this is very

291
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,440
silly this extraneous

292
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,600
kind of code that i'm doing but um

293
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,360
i think

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,640
this will help

295
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
yeah so i just wanted to draw some lines

296
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
over it now

297
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
now we are really getting somewhere

298
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,040
because in theory if all i do is shuffle

299
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,920
this array right have all of the

300
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
elements of the array

301
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
in random order

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,959
then i should see the image

303
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,720
chopped up and moved around so let's do

304
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,399
that so i'm going to write a function

305
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,920
called shuffle which receives an array

306
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,200
uh and then i'm going to

307
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,279
just say like um a hundred times

308
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,920
pick r1 is array dot rand a random

309
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,959
number

310
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
floor a random number between zero and

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
the length of the array

312
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
r2

313
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
is floor

314
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
a random number between 0 and the length

315
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
of the array now in theory i don't want

316
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
these two elements to be the same but

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
i'm doing it a bunch of times i want to

318
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,839
swap i'm just the way i'm going to

319
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,440
shuffle the array is by picking any two

320
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
elements and swapping their place

321
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
so now

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
temp

323
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,800
is that arrays r1 value

324
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,760
then

325
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,880
and you know i'm going to need i'm going

326
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
to write a swap function because i'm

327
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,639
going to need that i think also when i

328
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
move the pieces

329
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,519
so function swap

330
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,560
is

331
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
uh swap

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,880
index i and j of an array

333
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,920
so temp is index i

334
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,000
and then that arrays

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,519
i element

336
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,800
is

337
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,079
the j element and the j element is that

338
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,440
temporary value now you might be

339
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
wondering like what what and there's a

340
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
way i know there's some like object

341
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
deconstruction way i can do a swap and

342
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,959
i'll put it up on the screen if i ever

343
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,600
make this into an edited video but

344
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
basically the old-fashioned oh the old

345
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
old way that we used to swap our

346
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
elements in an array is we take element

347
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,160
one

348
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,680
store it somewhere temporary because we

349
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,240
need to put a new thing in that spot and

350
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
then we saved it temporarily we could

351
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,079
put that thing we saved in the spot that

352
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,639
just the other thing came out of so now

353
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,040
i want to swap

354
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
r1r2

355
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,639
in that array

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
so let's shuffle

357
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
i don't need to shuffle the tiles the

358
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
tiles is just an array of elements i'm

359
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
shuffling the array that's keeping track

360
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,079
of the index indices of all of them

361
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,399
maybe i didn't need these two arrays but

362
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,519
it's the way that i'm thinking of it

363
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,839
right now shuffle the board

364
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
oh

365
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,680
well good thing i wrote my own shuffle

366
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,279
function p5 the reason i'm getting that

367
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,959
error is there already is a global

368
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,200
function in p5 called shuffle and it

369
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,680
uses this fischer yates shuffle

370
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,160
algorithm which i can only assume is

371
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
better than whatever i did although is

372
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
it the same i don't know we could read

373
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
this page and discover we should it

374
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,600
could be another coding challenge the

375
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,519
fischer yates shuffle algorithm you know

376
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna call

377
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
this a simple shuffle

378
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that way and i could use the p51 you

379
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
should try it yourself

380
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,199
there we go look

381
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
i have mixed up the elements

382
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
all right so one thing that for it to be

383
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,120
a slide puzzle that i need to do

384
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,399
is

385
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,000
i need

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
to be able to

387
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
remove one of them

388
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
so

389
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,079
uh columns and then uh let's just

390
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,000
delete the last one pop is it pop

391
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
and

392
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,959
that'll be empty

393
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,199
okay great so as long as if tile index

394
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
is greater than zero

395
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
draw the image

396
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,399
so now

397
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,519
whoops greater than negative one

398
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,880
okay so now i have made the board i

399
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,959
could shuffle it

400
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
i could still shuffle it now but this

401
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
shuffling is no good

402
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,519
because in theory now is it possible

403
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
that it's unsolvable i need a move

404
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,199
basically i need a function that like

405
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,240
moves

406
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
one element

407
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,399
so

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
function

409
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,120
move

410
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,160
so the function is going to receive a

411
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
given index

412
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,560
so the idea is i'm clicking on an index

413
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
like i'm going to click on one of them

414
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,279
and it's only a valid move if it's above

415
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,600
below to the right or to the left

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
so i do need this function like the

417
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,040
column is index well you know what i

418
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,839
could

419
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
i could pick a random

420
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,959
column or row i need to know where the

421
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
negative one is

422
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,240
so let's let's just have a variable

423
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,320
blank spot is

424
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
you know what i'm going to do i'm going

425
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
to write a function

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,480
find blank

427
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
so this is a way to quickly check all of

428
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
it to find which one is blank

429
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
so the blank

430
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,720
i the blank column is the blank spot

431
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
modulus the number of columns and the

432
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
blank row is

433
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,880
floor

434
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
the blank index divided by the number of

435
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,560
rows that's the inverse of putting it

436
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
back i should just use the

437
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
two-dimensional array

438
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
okay so

439
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
that's the blank column in row so i and

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
j if i and j is a neighbor if is

441
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,519
neighbor

442
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,600
i j

443
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,560
blank

444
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
there's got to be an easier way to check

445
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
if it's a neighbor right

446
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
so if it's a neighbor

447
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
then swap

448
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
blank

449
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,079
with

450
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
i plus j

451
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
j times columns of that array

452
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,199
so the move

453
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,240
basically the idea of doing a move is

454
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,480
uh there's a spot that i want to move if

455
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
it's a proper neighbor to the blank spot

456
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
then it can be swapped with it

457
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
oh no that's not yeah yeah when you move

458
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,440
a thing and tile into it it becomes the

459
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
blank spot okay

460
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
so i just need now an is neighbor

461
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
function

462
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,639
you the viewer will write this in a so

463
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
much better way i'm on a time crunch

464
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,959
here i'm way over my 30 minute limit

465
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,400
function is neighbor i'm just doing x1

466
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,359
y1 x2 y2

467
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
well let me do i j

468
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
i j x y

469
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
so first

470
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,520
if

471
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,199
i is not equal to x

472
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,880
and j is not equal to y

473
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
return

474
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
return false

475
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
it's either got to be in the same column

476
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
or the same row so if they're both not

477
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
the same

478
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,679
then it's not a neighbor if

479
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,960
the absolute value of i minus x

480
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
equals

481
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
one

482
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
it's one spot away

483
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
or

484
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
the absolute value of

485
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,280
j minus y

486
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,520
if it's one spot away

487
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
returned true and i know i could return

488
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
like the result or whatever

489
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
otherwise it's the same spot so i'm just

490
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
gonna say return false

491
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,600
if it gets the end i think this will

492
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
work

493
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
just did that kind of like awkwardly

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
right it's got to both be

495
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
in either the same column or row and one

496
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
spot away so now

497
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
shuffling is should be

498
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,440
picking a move

499
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,559
random

500
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,760
columns

501
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
and random rows

502
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,679
i know i could just pick from valid

503
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
neighbors to do a move but if i do it

504
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,360
enough times i'll pick valid neighbors

505
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
enough times that this should work so

506
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
now i should just say move

507
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
r1 and r2

508
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,039
and

509
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
move if it's a

510
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
finds the blank spot and if the blank

511
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,720
spot is a neighbor it swaps it with i

512
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
don't know if this is going to work

513
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
let's just try it

514
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,360
array ah move

515
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
i guess move should the function should

516
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
get the array i mean i'm only using one

517
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
array

518
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
so it's a little bit silly

519
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,400
there we go okay

520
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,799
so that that's a valid shuffling now i'm

521
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,240
just curious let me make this a random

522
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,200
move function

523
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,840
again i will refactor this later i mean

524
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
i don't know if i will

525
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
let's do random move

526
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
so like if i do a thousand moves

527
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,720
oh uh array

528
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,400
it's a little bit silly how i have to

529
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
like i'm not using global variables as

530
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
well okay so that should be a random

531
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,679
shuffling that's possible but just out

532
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
of curiosity

533
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,120
in draw

534
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
if i just said

535
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,919
random move

536
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,400
of the tiles but i don't want to shuffle

537
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
it i just want to see it doing one move

538
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
per

539
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,679
okay cannot read properties of undefined

540
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,960
image

541
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,799
oh board it's the board

542
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,400
there we go oh

543
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
oh i'm not drawing the background so the

544
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,520
old piece is there

545
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,679
okay this is it shuffling the puzzle

546
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,200
randomly

547
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
oh i love this

548
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
all i need to do now is have a mouse

549
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
pressed function

550
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,120
i'm going to go back to shuffling it to

551
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
start so take out this

552
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,440
and mousepress function is so the column

553
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
that i'm clicking on is

554
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,720
floor mousex divided by the number of

555
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,559
columns

556
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,440
right

557
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,000
and the row and i'm gonna call this i

558
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,240
and the row that i'm clicking on

559
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,039
is floor mouse y

560
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,760
divided by the number of rows and then

561
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
move i

562
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,679
j tiles

563
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,840
now i'm not giving myself any feedback

564
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,679
or i'm not seeing an animation all of

565
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,200
those are things that i hope that you

566
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
will add it should move if it's a valid

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
neighbor what what did i

568
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
so console log i

569
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,320
j

570
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
60 oh whoops

571
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
no no no no divided by w and h

572
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
not divided by the number of columns

573
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,039
divided by the width of the column is it

574
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,039
zero one or two okay

575
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,640
it's like what am i losing my mind here

576
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,840
okay

577
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,679
no oh not the tiles not the tiles the

578
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,559
board the board

579
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,240
yeah look at that

580
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,080
now i'm pressing the buttons and so now

581
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,799
it is solved

582
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,200
if is solved

583
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
uh if so console.log

584
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,039
solved

585
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,880
we will not have any fanfare just a

586
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,200
console log solved so i'm gonna write a

587
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
function

588
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,640
is solved

589
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
where i'm going to go 4 let i equal 0 i

590
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
is less than board dot length

591
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
minus 1. i don't need to check the last

592
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,360
one

593
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,280
i plus plus

594
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,799
and then if

595
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,640
board

596
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,240
index i is not equal to

597
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,679
tiles index i dot index right isn't that

598
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,559
didn't i save where it's supposed to be

599
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,280
yes in the tile class

600
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
then that's a piece that's in the wrong

601
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
place

602
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
so return false

603
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,159
and if you get through everything

604
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,080
all of them are in the right place

605
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,919
return true so if i don't shuffle

606
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,360
the board at all

607
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
it's solved it's showing me it's solved

608
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,960
now if i shuffle it in setup

609
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
it's not solved and i can solve it okay

610
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
let's make it easier for me to solve oh

611
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,480
my god i think i got this i think i did

612
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,679
it

613
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,919
so let's just shuffle it

614
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,919
simple shuffle like

615
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,559
five times

616
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,720
okay no it didn't pick oh there we go

617
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,240
okay great so in theory all i need to do

618
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,120
is just click on this element

619
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,799
it will move up and go into place

620
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,559
solved

621
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,720
yay okay awesome so um just for fun

622
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,600
cause what are we doing but having fun i

623
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
am going to

624
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
have it be eight by eight

625
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,679
and i am going to let it shuffle a

626
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,480
hundred times

627
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,039
like i guess there's more pieces it's

628
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
not going to pick the thing randomly but

629
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
hold on this is a little bit harder

630
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
solved i did it

631
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,360
no let's keep it but this is kind of fun

632
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
because you realize you could do like

633
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,640
you know

634
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,559
a 20 by 20 slide puzzle here

635
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,120
right and how many times do i need like

636
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,520
you know obviously again i need a better

637
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
shuffling algorithm but if i do it 10

638
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
000 times

639
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,679
you know that's a lot of interesting

640
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,679
moves there but let's go back to making

641
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
it four by four and make this puzzle

642
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,320
solvable for myself this is the last

643
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,760
thing i'm going to do

644
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,320
i'm gonna make it four by four

645
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,440
i'm going to shuffle it just 100 times

646
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,720
and let's see if i can solve this

647
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
oh shoot

648
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,200
oh wait a sec

649
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,319
[Music]

650
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,279
i think i did it

651
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,320
yes

652
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,400
i solved it all right

653
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,039
so what can you do well you can be more

654
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
thoughtful about what image you pick you

655
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
could add animations there's a million

656
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
opportunities to refactor this code to

657
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
make it more s make more sense i mean

658
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,360
this object could do so much i started

659
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,720
like i need to make this object-oriented

660
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
but i did not follow through with that

661
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
but also one prompt that i would have

662
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,520
for you is there's no reason you

663
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,360
couldn't do this with a video or some

664
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,679
abstract generative art drawing i mean

665
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,200
so many possibilities there because as

666
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,799
long as you have an image even if it's

667
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,120
an image that's changing over time you

668
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
can shuffle it and you can solve it and

669
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
a move counter for scoring so many

670
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,760
things

671
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
if you like this coding challenge video

672
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,120
and are wondering what happened inside

673
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
all of those little cuts and edits i'd

674
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,720
like to encourage you to sign up for
